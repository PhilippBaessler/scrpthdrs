This package provides functionality to quickly insert a preformatted comment header into your R script files with a basic set of meta data such as

-   script author

-   contact email of author

-   R version and date at the time the header is created

-   a descriptive title of the script

-   script filename

-   description

## Prerequisites

::: callout
**RStudio is required**
:::

This package relies on core functionality provided by the RStudio API. As a result, this package will not work as intended if used outside of an RStudio session. The comment header will always be inserted in the file that has the **active focus** in the RStudio editor pane.

## Usage

Use the function `insert_comment_header()` to add a formatted header at the top of your R script:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(scrpthdrs)
insert_comment_header(author = "My Name", email = "my.email@domain.com")
```

There are two types of preformatted headers you can select from: `'small'` and `'large'` which are selected via the `type` argument.

The `'small'` header (the **default**) can include *author name* (`author`) and *author email (`email`*) as well as a *script title* (`header`), all of which are optional. To exclude the *author name* use `author = NULL` explicitly. `email` and `header` are excluded by default and must be set explicitly to be included in the header. In addition, the current R version and the current date at the time of the insertion will be included in the comment.

For example,

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
insert_comment_header(author = "My Name",
                      email = "my.name@domain.com",
                      header = "This is my script")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
header <- scrpthdrs:::small_header_constructor(
    author = "My Name",
    email = "my.name@domain.com",
    header = "This is my script"
)

cat(header)
```

The `'large'` header has a wider footprint and can include *script filename* (`script_title`) and a description (`description`) in addition to the options of the `small` header. By default, the *script filename* will be inserted automatically, if the focused file has a filename (i.e., has already been saved at least once). You can opt out of this behavior by setting `script_title = NULL` or use an arbitrary name with `script_title = my_filename.R`. Select the `large` header by setting `type = 'large'`.

For example, using the `large` type with a file called 'demo.R':

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
insert_comment_header(author = "My Name",
                      email = "my.name@domain.com",
                      header = "This is my script",
                      description = "This is a brief description for demonstration.",
                      type = "large")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
header <- scrpthdrs:::large_header_constructor(
    author = "My Name",
    email = "my.name@domain.com",
    header = "This is my script",
    description = "This is a brief description for demonstration.",
    script_title = "demo.R")
cat(header)
```

## Use the RStudio addin

The package registers an RStudio addin on installation. Find the RStudio addin here:

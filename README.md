`scrpthdrs` provides a very basic way to quickly insert a comment header at the top of an R script.

## Installation

You can install the development version of scrpthdrs from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("PhilippBaessler/scrpthdrs")
```

## Usage

The package provides a basic GUI via an RStudio Addin. It can be found in **Addins** âž” `scrpthdrs` / *Insert comment header*

Alternatively, the function can be called directly in the console assuming the R script file to which the comment header shall be added is open and focused in RStudio:

``` r
scrpthdrs::insert_comment_header(author = "My Name", email = "my.name@domain.com")
```
